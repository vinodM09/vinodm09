I am a passionate web developer with a keen interest in learning new programming languages and technologies. Currently, I am expanding my skill set by diving into C++ and mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Beyond web development, I have a strong fascination with space exploration and drone technology. I am always eager to explore how these fields can intersect and innovate. Whether I am coding a new website, developing software, or experimenting with drones, I am driven by curiosity and a love for technology.
